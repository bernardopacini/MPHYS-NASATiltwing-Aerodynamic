Overview
========

Pre-processing for analyses and optimizations of the tiltwing vehicle's wing requires geometry generation, aerodynamic meshing, and geometry parameterization.
These sections provide an overview of the processes carried out to complete these tasks, but do not include a step-by-step guide for generating each file.
Instead, the geometry and mesh files can be downloaded directly using the script in the ``inputData/`` directory.
To recreate the files from scratch, we recommend generating the geometry using the tiltwing OpenVSP model, meshing the wing with Cadence Pointwise, and parameterizing it using the provided Python script.
