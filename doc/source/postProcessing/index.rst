Overview
========

The analysis and optimizations carried out in this study were post-processed to visualize and understand the wings' design and performance with a variety of metics.
The exact scripts and workflows used to generate these renderings are not included in this repository, but they can be recreated using the optimization history and flow solution files.
We recommend using Paraview, TecPlot, and Python scripting to generate the desired visualizations and graphics.

This section of the documentation details the optimization histories and main takeaways, as well as the aerodynamic performance of the baseline and optimized wings.
The presented results may differ from results obtained when rerunning the optimizations, but the overall trends should be consistent.
