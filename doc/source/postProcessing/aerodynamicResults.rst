Aerodynamic Results
===================

The coefficient of pressure on the top surface of the baseline wing for all propeller configurations are shown below.
The contour plots show areas of higher and lower pressure on the wing behind the up-going and down-going propeller blade regions.
Apart from these slight variations, the wings show similar results across the remainder of the top surfaces.

   Contours of :math:`C_P` on the top surface of the baseline wings for the distributed propulsion configurations with varying number of propellers. (a) No propellers, (b) 1 propeller, (c) 2 propellers, (d) 3 propellers, (e) 4 propellers, and (f) 5 propellers.

The spanwise normalized lift, twist, and thickness for the baseline design are shown below.
The twist and thickness for baseline are constant, as designed.
The normalized lift distributions show oscillations that correspond with the deviations imparted by the propellers.
All of the cases show similar performance with sub-optimal lift distributions that show loading near the tip and decreased loading at the root, compared to the optimal elliptical distribution.

The coefficient of pressure on the top surface of the optimized wing for all propeller configurations are shown below.
The contour plots show similar variations in pressure as the baseline, marking the influence of the propellers on the wing.
Compared to the baseline, all of the wings show increased suction shifted back aft from the leading edge.

   Contours of :math:`C_P` on the top surface of the optimized wing for the distributed propulsion configurations with varying number of propellers. (a) No propellers, (b) 1 propeller, (c) 2 propellers, (d) 3 propellers, (e) 4 propellers, and (f) 5 propellers.

The spanwise normalized lift, twist, and thickness for the optimized designs are shown below.
The twist distributions show oscillations that do not follow a specific trend, apart from slight oscillations through the midspan and a large oscillation near the tip, resulting in larger twist at the wing tip.
The thicknesses for all of the cases are very similar, with slight oscillations in the spanwise direction and a decrease at the tip.
The noralized lift for all of the cases track an ideal elliptical distribution, with oscillations behind the propellers.
While the oscillations match the baseline design, the loading distributios are significantly improved.
